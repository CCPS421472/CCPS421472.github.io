        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>1.  I'm working towards being in the NFL but as of now just making a varsity football team. what experiences led me to work towards this was when I met my first NFL players and Daren Waller gave a a speech to one of my youth football teams about motivation and how hard it was for him.

2.  I'm working towards these goals buy working out everyday not sitting around and by going outside and running playing basketball working on foot steps and my catching ability.

3.  I see my getting faster as a huge key in making these goals come true along with catching and ability to hit hard without sustaining injurie. 

4.  short term would be to just get as fast as possible by the summer so I'm hoping to run a 4.9 40 yard and to also break 300lbs for squat by the summer.

5.  I want to be know for being a humble football player never cocky in anyway.
